This will be the first data science meeting of 2016.

During this meeting we want to take the time to get to know the members of our
community and plan what our future meetups will look like.

We'd like to get your feedback on:

• Who you are

• What kinds of projects you work on

• The tools you use

• The tools your interested in learning back

• Exciting things that you'd like to learn in the future

We'll also be doing a short 5-10 minute presentation of what one of our members
are currently working on.

Once we've collected your feedback during the meeting, we'll use that to help
plan more monthly meetings in the future.

We look forward to meeting you all on November 3rd, 2016 at 6:00 pm!
